This is a work in progress. Do not expect anything to work. The documentation below is currently aspirational (meaning this is what we're planning to implement).

# Usage

You can test this web app without a sudowrt install by running:

```
node server.js
```

When testing the web app, all luci2 API calls will return fake (but plausible) responses.
